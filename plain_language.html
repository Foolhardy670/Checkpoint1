            <p>
                Plain language is a way of writing that makes it easier for everyone to understand your message the
                first time they read or hear it.
                It helps readers find what they need, understand what they find, and use it effectively. Plain language
                matters because it builds trust, increases clarity, and ensures inclusivity for all types of
                audiences—including those with cognitive, literacy, or language barriers.

            <h2>Plain Language Summary</h2>

            <h3>Audience Understanding</h3>
            <p>
                The first rule of plain language is to know who you're writing for. Think about what your audience
                already knows, what they need, and how they prefer to get information.
            </p>

            <h3>Clear Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Use headers, short paragraphs, and lists to organize content. This helps readers scan quickly and stay
                focused.
            </p>

            <h3>Simple Words</h3>
            <p>
                Choose everyday words and avoid jargon or technical terms unless absolutely necessary. If you need to
                use a technical term, define it clearly.
            </p>

            <h3>Active Voice</h3>
            <p>
                Write sentences using the subject-verb-object order. For example, say "We send invoices every Friday"
                instead of "Invoices are sent every Friday."
            </p>

            <h3>Testing and Feedback</h3>
            <p>
                Once your content is written, test it with real users. Feedback helps you find unclear areas and improve
                your message.
            </p>

        <!-- Verbs Explained Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Verbs Explained</h2>

            <h3>Why Verbs Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Verbs carry the action of a sentence and help the reader understand what needs to happen. Strong,
                specific verbs improve clarity and guide the reader toward action.
            </p>

            <h3>Use Strong Action Verbs</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of using vague verbs like “do” or “make,” choose specific ones like “build,” “write,” or
                “design.” This gives more meaning to your sentence.
            </p>

            <h3>Avoid Hidden Verbs</h3>
            <p>
                Hidden verbs are nouns formed from verbs—like “implementation” instead of “implement.” Turn them back
                into action verbs to make your writing more direct.
                <br>
                <strong>Example:</strong> “We will begin the implementation of the program.” → “We will implement the
                program.”
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Examples Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Examples</h2>

            <h3>Example 1: Use Headings to Guide Readers</h3>
            <p>
                Without clear headings, readers can get lost in walls of text. Break your document into sections with
                short, descriptive headers.
                <br>
                <strong>Before:</strong> A long email with no paragraph breaks or headings. <br>
                <strong>After:</strong> Use "Payment Info," "Next Steps," and "Help" as section titles.
            </p>

            <h3>Example 2: Prefer Active Voice</h3>
            <p>
                Passive voice makes writing harder to follow. Use active voice to be clear about who’s doing what.
                <br>
                <strong>Before:</strong> “The report was written by the team.” <br>
                <strong>After:</strong> “The team wrote the report.”
            </p>

            <h3>Example 3: Keep Sentences Short</h3>
            <p>
                Long sentences are harder to follow. Aim for one idea per sentence.
                <br>
                <strong>Before:</strong> “In order to submit your application, you must fill out the form and return it
                via email no later than May 1st.” <br>
                <strong>After:</strong> “Fill out the form and email it by May 1st to apply.”
