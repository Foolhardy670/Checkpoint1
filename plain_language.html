            <p>
                Plain language is a way of writing that makes it easier for everyone to understand your message the
                first time they read or hear it. It helps readers find what they need, understand what they find, and
                use it effectively.
                Plain language matters because it builds trust, increases clarity, and ensures inclusivity for all types
                of
                audiences—including those with cognitive, literacy, or language barriers.

            <h3>1. Know Your Audience</h3>
            <p>Understanding your audience is key to effective communication. Writers should tailor content to their
                readers' needs, knowledge, and expectations.</p>

            <h3>2. Organize Content Clearly</h3>
            <p>A well-structured document improves readability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize important information at the beginning</li>
                <li>Use headings and subheadings to break up sections</li>
                <li>Convert dense paragraphs into bullet points or numbered lists</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Use Simple, Direct Language</h3>
            <p>Plain language avoids complex words, technical jargon, and long-winded sentences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use familiar words and short sentences</li>
                <li>Keep explanations straightforward</li>
                <li>Define technical terms when necessary</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Prefer Active Voice</h3>
            <p>Active voice makes sentences clearer and more engaging:</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Passive:</strong> "The report was completed by the team."</p>
                <p><strong>Active:</strong> "The team completed the report."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>5. Maintain Consistency</h3>
            <p>Consistency in tone, terminology, and formatting helps readers follow along without confusion.</p>

                        <td>Implementation of new regulations will have been carried out by the compliance team by the
                            end of the year.</td>
                        <td>The compliance team will implement the new regulations by year's end.</td>
                    </tr>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Paragraph Improvements</h3>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>Original:</h4>
                <p>Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of sustainability in corporate practices, there
                    are numerous organizations that continue to prioritize short-term profits, which ultimately detracts
                    from the long-term viability of both the companies and the communities in which they operate.</p>

                <h4>Improved:</h4>
                <p>Many organizations prioritize short-term profits over sustainability goals — which have been
                    recognized as important — harming their long-term success and the communities they serve.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="verbs">
            <h2 id="verbs">Verb Usage in Plain Language</h2>

            <h3>Why Verbs Matter</h3>
            <p>Verbs carry the action of a sentence and help the reader understand what needs to happen. Strong,
                specific verbs improve clarity and guide the reader toward action.</p>

            <h3>Use Strong Action Verbs</h3>
            <p>Instead of vague verbs like "do" or "make," choose specific ones like "build," "write," or "design."</p>

            <h3>Avoid Hidden Verbs</h3>
            <p>Hidden verbs are nouns formed from verbs—like "implementation" instead of "implement." Turn them back
                into action verbs:</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Before:</strong> "We will begin the implementation of the program."</p>
                <p><strong>After:</strong> "We will implement the program."</p>
            </div>
