                        Hello! I'm Christian, a web developer who believes in building experiences
                        that work for everyone. I'm passionate about front-end development and take great care
                        to create accessible, user-friendly designs. I'm constantly learning how to make the
                        web a more inclusive space where users of all abilities can interact with ease and dignity.

                    <h2>My Passion for Hiking</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll often find me on hiking trails. This photo shows me enjoying
                        a beautiful day outdoors with my girlfriend. Hiking helps me de-stress and improves my mood,
                        giving me the energy and clarity I need for my web development work. Being in nature reminds
                        me that accessibility isn't just digital - physical spaces should be inclusive too.

            <h2 id="accessibility-philosophy">When I Hear "Accessibility"</h2>
            <p>
                When I hear the word "accessibility," I think of fairness, empathy, and opportunity.
                Accessibility means ensuring that everyone—regardless of ability, device, or background—
                can access and enjoy digital content. On the web, accessibility isn't a bonus feature;
                it's a basic human right. I believe the internet should be inclusive, not exclusive.

        <section aria-labelledby="beyond-tools">
            <h2 id="beyond-tools">Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
            <p>
                Automated tools are great for catching common accessibility issues, but they are far from complete.
                These tools can't tell if the alt text is meaningful, if the focus order makes sense, or if the content
                structure
                is logical for assistive technologies. Manual testing, user feedback, and empathy are
                essential for achieving true accessibility.

        <section aria-labelledby="standards">
            <h2 id="standards">Accessibility Standards I Use</h2>
            <p>
                I follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to ensure my projects are perceivable,
                operable, understandable, and robust. I use semantic HTML, descriptive alt text, proper color contrast,
                and ARIA attributes responsibly. I also test with screen readers and validate accessibility using
                multiple tools.

        <section aria-labelledby="inclusive-design">
            <h2 id="inclusive-design">Why Inclusion During Design Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Including people with disabilities during the design process helps identify real-world barriers
                early on. Inclusive design means considering different abilities, ages, and experiences to build
                something better for everyone.

            <h2 id="statement">My Accessibility Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. I continually improve
                the user experience for everyone and apply relevant accessibility standards. My goal is to conform
                to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines. If you encounter any accessibility barriers in my work, please
                <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conformance status:</strong> My websites are partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA,
                meaning some content may not fully meet all accessibility guidelines. I am actively working to improve
                this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Feedback:</strong> I welcome your feedback on the accessibility of my websites. Please let me
                know if you encounter accessibility barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technical specifications:</strong> Accessibility relies on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA
                following WCAG guidelines.
