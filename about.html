            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Christian, a web developer who believes in building experiences
                that work for everyone. I’m passionate about front-end development and take great care
                to create accessible, user-friendly designs. I’m constantly learning how to make the
                web a more inclusive space where users of all abilities can interact with ease and dignity.

            <h2>When I Hear “Accessibility”</h2>
            <p>
                When I hear the word “accessibility,” I think of fairness, empathy, and opportunity.
                Accessibility means ensuring that everyone—regardless of ability, device, or background—
                can access and enjoy digital content. On the web, accessibility isn’t a bonus feature;
                it’s a basic human right. I believe the internet should be inclusive, not exclusive.
                As a developer, I feel a responsibility to create interfaces that accommodate screen readers,
                keyboard users, and those with visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments. Accessibility
                also aligns with good design and improves user experience for all users.
            </p>

            <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
            <p>
                Automated tools are great for catching common accessibility issues, but they are far from complete.
                These tools can check for missing alt attributes, color contrast ratios, or form labeling—but they
                can't tell if the alt text is meaningful, if the focus order makes sense, or if the content structure
                is logical for assistive technologies. For example, having an alt text like “IMG_1023.jpg” technically
                passes an automated test but adds no value to users. Manual testing, user feedback, and empathy are
                essential for achieving true accessibility.
            </p>

            <h2>Accessibility Standards I Use</h2>
            <p>
                I follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to ensure my projects are perceivable,
                operable, understandable, and robust. I use semantic HTML to give content meaning, add descriptive
                alt text to images, ensure good color contrast, and use ARIA attributes responsibly. I also ensure
                that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable and avoid using animations or elements that
                might trigger seizures or cognitive overload. I also test with screen readers and validate
                accessibility using tools like WAVE, Axe, and Lighthouse.

            <h2>Why Inclusion During Design Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Including people with disabilities during the design process helps identify real-world barriers
                early on. It’s one thing to follow guidelines; it’s another to listen to someone who uses a
                screen reader or navigates using only a keyboard. Inclusive design means considering different
                abilities, ages, and experiences to build something better for everyone. When we prioritize inclusion
                from the beginning, we make products that are not only more accessible but also more innovative,
                functional, and human-centered.

            <h2>My Accessibility Statement</h2>
            <p>
                I am committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. I continually improve
                the user experience for everyone and apply the relevant accessibility standards. My goal is to conform
                to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, ensuring content is usable by as many people as possible. If you
                experience any issues accessing content I’ve built.
