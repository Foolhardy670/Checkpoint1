            <p>The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans have a
                non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38.9 million adults with a disability in the United
                States, 19.7% live below the poverty line, nearly double the national average. Lower employment rates
                contribute to this disparity, with only 25.9% of disabled individuals over 16 employed in the civilian
                sector, compared to 59.6% of all U.S. citizens.</p>

            <p>Utah, in comparison, has a disabled population of 10.3%, which is lower than the national average of 13%.
                Representation by race also varies, with higher occurrences of disabilities in some minority communities
                in Utah compared to national figures.</p>

            <p>With over 40 million people in the U.S. living with disabilities, accessible web design is essential. A
                well-designed website ensures inclusivity, allowing everyone to access information and services
                seamlessly.</p>
