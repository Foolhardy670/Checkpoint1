            <p>The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans have a
                non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38.9 million adults with a disability in the United
                States, 19.7% live below the poverty line, nearly double the national average. Lower employment rates
                contribute to this disparity, with only 25.9% of disabled individuals over 16 employed in the civilian
                sector, compared to 59.6% of all U.S. citizens.</p>
            <p>Utah, in comparison, has a disabled population of 10.3%, which is lower than the national average of 13%.
                Representation by race also varies, with higher occurrences of disabilities in some minority communities
                in Utah compared to national figures.</p>

            <h2 id="importance-accessibility">Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>With over 40 million people in the U.S. living with disabilities, accessible web design is essential. A
                well-designed website ensures inclusivity, allowing everyone to access information and services
                seamlessly.</p>

            <h2 id="universal-design">Universal Design is Design for All</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The power of the web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless is an essential aspect."
                    - Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This website applies the principles of Universal Design, as defined by Ronald Mace and his team:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equitable Use</strong>: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse
                    abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Use</strong>: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences
                    and abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use</strong>: The design is easy to understand, regardless of the
                    userâ€™s experience or knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptible Information</strong>: The design communicates necessary information effectively
                    to all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Tolerance for Error</strong>: The design minimizes hazards and unintended consequences.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Physical Effort</strong>: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably.</li>
                <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use</strong>: The design provides appropriate size and space
                    for all users.</li>
            </ul>
